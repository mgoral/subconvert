Version history

0.8		:
* ADD: setup.py (installer)
* ADD: GUI

	being updated but also quits batch work.
* FIX: remove file extension from subviewer's [TITLE]
* FIX: let the shell find python in $PATH
* FIX: Add maximum file size limit to subtitle files.
* FIX: Better parsing state output.

* ADD: TMP sub formatting
* ADD: SubViewer sub formatting

0.6.2	: 13.11.2011
* ADD: mplayer auto-check more movie formats: mkv, mpg, mp4 and wmv
* ADD: handle multiple input files

* FIX: SubRip incorrect parsing (trivia: in my test subtitles a word which
	starts with 'f' appears for the first time in 119th subtitle)

	more info to verbose output

0.6.1	: 10.11.2011
* FIX: Uniform backup system
* FIX: A lot of code refactoring. Now works slightly faster

0.6 	: 10.11.2011
* ADD: getting FPS from avi files using MPlayer
* ADD: option to backup files if they exist (overwriting input files are back
	them up	automatically while output files are backed up explicitly)
