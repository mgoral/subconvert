Version history

0.8.3   :
* ADD:  Polish translation
* ADD:  Auto detection of more movie formats (both GUI and CLI)
* FIX:  SubConvert detects both upper case and lower case movie extensions
* FIX:  with '-v' option, SubConvert will not require any additional parameters
        and will simply try to get FPS from a given file

* FIX:  Tests work again

* ADD:  Unit tests
* ADD:  option to specify output file(s) encoding
* ADD:  MPL2 format support
* FIX:  HUGE code refactoring
* FIX:  ugly converting error (which doubled first subtitle and removed the 
        last one)

* FIX:  SubRip skipping last sub when no new line at the EOF (now Generic
        Parser forces parsing a section at the EOF)
* FIX:  smart skipping of incorrect empty lines

0.8.1   : 07.12.2011
* ADD:  SubConvert updater
* ADD:  encoding detecting (optional)

0.8.0-1 : 04.12.2011
* FIX:  unhandled assertion errors which were caused by incorrect subtitles

0.8     : 28.11.2011
* ADD:  setup.py (installer)
* ADD:  GUI
* ADD:  option to stop converting when file exists. Not only it stops file from
        being updated but also quits batch work.
* FIX:  remove file extension from subviewer's [TITLE]
* FIX:  let the shell find python in $PATH
* FIX:  Add maximum file size limit to subtitle files.
* FIX:  Better parsing state output.
* FIX:  Don't save not completely parsed files anymore.

0.7     : 19.11.2011
* ADD:  TMP sub formatting
* ADD:  SubViewer sub formatting
* ADD:  full converting subtitles without sub end time
* ADD:  support subtitles with header
* FIX:  error on -m option mistyped
* FIX:  error that prevented sub parsing when no sub end time was present

0.6.2   : 13.11.2011
* ADD:  mplayer auto-check more movie formats: mkv, mpg, mp4 and wmv
* ADD:  handle multiple input files
* ADD:  option to specify output file(s) extension
* FIX:  SubRip incorrect parsing (trivia: in my test subtitles a word which
        starts with 'f' appears for the first time in 119th subtitle)
* FIX:  not clear notifications about parsing and IO operations state + add some
        more info to verbose output

0.6.1   : 10.11.2011
* FIX:  Uniform backup system
* FIX:  A lot of code refactoring. Now works slightly faster

0.6     : 10.11.2011
* ADD:  getting FPS from avi files using MPlayer
* ADD:  option to backup files if they exist (overwriting input files are back
        them up automatically while output files are backed up explicitly)
* FIX:  code refactoring. Until now subconvert reads whole files to the memory
        which speeds it up almost twice
* FIX:  bug where parsing empty files returned results

0.5.2   : 09.11.2011
* ADD:  force option
* ADD:  verbose option
* FIX:  writing a newly created file
