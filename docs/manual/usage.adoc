== Usage

*REMEMBER*: You can always get a brief, up-to-date explanation of all Subconvert
options by calling `subconvert --help`.

=== Starting Subconvert

You can use Subconvert both as a console or a <<gui>> application. By default
Subconvert is started as a GUI application.  It nicely installs itself into most
menus under *Audio/Video* category. Program launchers like Gnome-Do or Kupfer
should recognize it as well. If your File Manager supports such behaviour, you
can right-click on subtitle file, select *Open With...* (or a similar option)
and choose Subconvert as your desired editor for subtitle files.

To start graphical interface, simply call:

----
$ subconvert [options] [subtitles]
----

If you wish to run Subconvert as a console script which will simply perform a
certain job on given files, call:

----
$ subconvert -c [options] subtitles
----
