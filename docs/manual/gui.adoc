=== Window layout

Main Subconvert window consists of several of tabs and panels. 

image::{filelist}[File list]

First tab is always a **file list**. You cannot close it or move it. It contains
a list of *loaded* subtitle files with several handy informations about them
plus an icon representing current state of file status. If file's modified
somehow, it changes to a yellow star. If it's "clean" (i.e. not modified), it
changes to a green tick. 

Next tabs (second one, third one and so on) contain **opened subtitle files**.
New tabs are not opened by default. To *open* a file in a new tab double click
it on a file list. To open a file in new tab in background middle-click it.

Above the file list there's a **video player** panel. It shows currently opened
video file and its state. You can toggle its visibility under
`View/Movie player` menu.

On the left there's a **subtitle panel**. It displays informations about
subtitles opened in a current tab.
