= AVAILABLE FORMATS

Subconvert will automatically detect a subtitle format in a given subtitle file.
When you want to specify the output format, you have to use `-t` or `--format`
switch, followed by a proper format name (case insensitive). For example:
`subconvert -t mpl2 SubRipSubtitles.srt` will produce MPL2 output subtitles. If
you don't provide any format, Subconvert will use SubRip as default.

== Subrip

=== Looks like:

----
0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
This is first subtitle.

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,549
This is a simple Sub Rip file
which has more than one line.
----

Subtitle blocks are separated by an empty line (`\n`, `\r\n` or `\r`, depending
on a platform). There is also a second type of SubRip notation available (which
is much less frequently met):

----
0 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
This is first subtitle.

1 00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,549
This is a simple Sub Rip file
which has more than one line.
----

=== Notes:

* Subconvert format name: subrip
* Default file extension: srt
* Format type: time (miliseconds precision)
* Text formatting: probably not supported officially by a subtitle standard but
  most of applications implement formatting that imitates HTML tags
  (`<i>Italics</i>`, `<b>Bold</b>`, `<u>Underscore</u>`). SubConvert supports
  this kind of text formatting too.

=== Looks like:

----
{0}{21}This is first subtitle.

{100}{125}{y:i}{y:b}{y:u}This is formatted text|and it's second line|{y:i}{y:b}{y:u}and the third one
----

=== Notes:

* SubConvert format name: microdvd
* Default file extension: sub
* Format type: frame

  beginning of the new line. Subconvert supports three of them: italics
  `{y:i}`, bold `{y:b}` and underline `{y:u}`. They can be combined.

== MPL2

=== Looks like:

----
[0][8]This is first subtitle.

  by a slash character (`/`) in the beginning of the new line
