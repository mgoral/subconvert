== Preparing environment

To generate `.pot` file which contains all translatable strings, call:

----
$ cd po
$ make update-po
----

== Creating a new translation

If you'd like to add a new translation, you have to create `.po` file for your
language before you can edit it. The simplest (and the best) method is to use
`msginit`. Suppose that you'd like to translate Subconvert to German: 

----
$ cd po
$ msginit --locale de
----

This will create `po/de.po` file which you can edit (see below). Try to avoid
creating `.po` files by hand (e.g. by renaming `subconvert.pot`). `msginit`
approach has several advantages like generating correct
link:{plurals}[Plural-Forms] entries for most of languages.

You will also have to add your language to `po/LINGUAS` file. In `LINGUAS` all
languages occupy a single line and are sorted *alphabetically*, so please don't
mess that order when adding new languages (it's Subconvert's requirement, not
GNU one).

For a list of ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 language codes to use in above commands,
see link:{usual-lang-codes}[this] and link:{rare-lang-codes}[this]. Keep in mind
country code though: `en_US` is not the same as `en_UK`.


== Updating existing translations

`make update-po` (run inside "po" directory) should result in `subconvert.pot`
created and merged into all `.po` files in `po` directory. Ignore all languages
but the one you'd like to translate to. When you're done editing it with your
editor of choice (like Vim, Emacs or Poedit), run `make update-po` again, commit
changes and create a pull request.
