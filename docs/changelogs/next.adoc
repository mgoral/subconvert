= Subconvert next changelog

== Changes since 2.1.0:

=== New features

* **[BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE]** Move Subconvert build and installation to
  setuptools and tox.

Autotools build system is now removed. Thanks to this, after few years,
Subconvert is brought back to PYPI (but under a new link).

* Added subtitle synchronization and offsetting.
+
Subtitles can be now synchronized to selected time points in a movie, or can be
offsetted, i.e. changed by some fixed value.

* Side panel's view is tabbed.

=== Bug fixes

* Fixed incorrect slot definition which prevented starting Subconvert in GUI
  mode.

* Fixed a crash when sending any command to MPlayer process.
+
Strings are no longer accepted, only encoded byte steams.

* Fixed not changing framerate of particular subtitles when detecting it from
  linked videos.

* Fixed adding/removing/modifying subtitles for all opened tabs.

=== Other changes

* Moved documentation from online wiki to `docs` directory.

* Switch to py.test for running tests.
