= SUBCONVERT

Subconvert is Python application which is capable to do convertions between
various popular subtitle formats. It is also smart enough to automatically
detect files format, encoding and even movie FPS (if there is any movie given).

If you are a programmer you will be happy to hear that it's also easily
extensible to provide support to additional formats!

This documentation contains all the link:manual/usage.md[usage] information you
will need, no matter if you are SubConvert user or a programmer.
