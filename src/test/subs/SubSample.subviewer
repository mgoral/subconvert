[COLF]&HFFFFFF,[STYLE]no,[SIZE]24,[FONT]Tahoma
00:00:00.00,00:00:01.00
This is first subtitle.

00:00:01.20,00:00:03.00
This is a simple MicroDVD file

00:00:04.00,00:00:06.00
It is UTF8 encoded




00:00:06.04,00:00:06.12
Strange timings

00:00:08.00,00:00:16.00
This is a very, very, very long line
which moreover has a newline inside

00:00:40.00,00:00:44.00
This is a subtitle after a very long break

00:00:36.00,00:00:42.00
This is wrong subtitle to see how will parser react

00:00:44.00,00:00:45.00
Some special characters: ~`!@#$%^&*()_-+=<>?/:;"'{}[]

00:00:46.00,00:00:47.00
Will parser escape those? /t/r/n

00:01:20.00,00:01:22.00
This is last subtitle.
