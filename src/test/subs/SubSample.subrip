00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
This is first subtitle.

1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,000
<i>This is a simple subtitle file</i>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It is UTF8 encoded

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,120
Strange timings

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is a very, very, very long line
which moreover has a newline inside

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is a subtitle after a very long break

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is wrong subtitle to see how will parser react

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Some special characters: ~`!@#$%^&*()_-+=<>?/:;"'{}[]

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Will parser escape those? /t/r/n

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is last subtitle.
